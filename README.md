#CL - Homes

A NYC based housing/apartment-listing application. I began this as a clone of craigslist's housing section but immediately became fascinated with the NYC housing market and the role the vital role Internet plays in it.

As far as the functionality goes, my goals here are two fold: 
1) To implement a wide range of features varying in scope, complexity, and utilized technologies. 
2) To build on the core features standard to most urban housing apps such as craigslist, nakedapartments, View the Space and Trulia, adding touches and functionality where I feel other apps are lacking.

This is very much a work-in-progress, but please have a look around! You can also see it live at www.cl-homes.us .
